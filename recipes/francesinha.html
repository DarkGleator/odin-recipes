    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Francesinha is a traditional Portuguese sandwich, often described as a "Portuguese croque-monsieur." </p>
    <p>It consists of layers of thinly sliced cured meats, such as ham and linguiça (smoked sausage), and steak, all sandwiched between slices of bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices/pp Loaf Bread (thick cut)</li>
        <li>1 Linguiça/pp Cured traditional Portuguese pork sausage with a distinct orange look due to the usage of paprika. Aka “Portuguese Sausage” in the New England area and Hawai. Also can be found in Brazilian stores/butchers.</li>
        <li>1 Sausage/pp (salsicha fresca) Uncured traditional Portuguese pork sausage. Closest equivalent would be Italian sausage.</li>
        <li>2 slices/pp Ham (sliced thin)</li>
        <li>2 slices/pp Baloney (sliced thin)</li>
        <li>1 steak/pp Rump steak (cut thin)</li>
        <li>5-6 slices/pp Flamengo cheese slices</li>
        <li>1 Egg/pp (optional)</li>
        <li>130 g/pp Fries (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slightly toast the bread – in the oven or in the toaster but without smooshing it, so it doesn’t lose its thickness.</li>
        <li>Cook the steak medium/rare and allow it to rest away from the heat for a few minutes, to retain the juices. Slit it slightly so that it’s easier to cut later on.</li>
        <li>Cut the linguiça and the Italian sausage length wise and trim them, if necessary, to match the size of the bread. Cook them in the same pan as the steak.</li>
        <li>Fry the egg(s) in the same pan again (optional). Fry the potatoes on the side (opcional).</li>
        <li>Assembling: after toasted, place one slice of bread in a deep dish that can go in the oven, and lay the slices of ham and baloney over the bread; place the sausage and the linguiça interspersed, side by side, and then the steak; place the second slice of bread on top and cover it all with cheese slices.</li>
        <li>Turn on the broil and place it in the oven until the cheese has melted.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, (place the egg on top), pour at least two ladles of sauce over the francesinha and serve immediatly.</li>
        <li>Pour the rest of the sauce in a gravy boat and serve seperately (as well as the fries).</li>
    </ol>
